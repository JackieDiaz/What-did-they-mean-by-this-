This application takes in any text(we label as quotes) and runs an text generating API based on what text was sent to it. WARNING the find true meaning takes about 20-30 seconds to load onto your screen. Let the API do it's magic and it will give you the "meaning" behind what quote was entered in. 

Getting Started:
Simply create a speaker or speakers then start making quotes. It can be actual quotes from the speaker or it could be whatever you want to deem a quote. 

All speakers tab:
Use the All speakers tab to see all the speakers that have been created.
If you click on a speakers name it will send you to the individual speaker's page.

Speaker page:
here you can edit quotes or delete your quotes.

Quotes tab:
Use the Quotes tab to find all the quotes. 
The true meaning button generates the API and shows you the true meaning of your quote.
