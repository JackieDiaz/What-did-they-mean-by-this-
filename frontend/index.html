            Have you ever wondered what did someone mean when they said something? 
            Let's say you want to know what Friedrich Nietzsche meant when he said: 
            "Sometimes people don't want to hear the truth because they don't want their illusions destroyed."
            But you don't have the time or willpower to research who this person is or and what is the context is about what they said. 
            Great news because here at What did they mean by this anyone can find the true meaning of any quote! 
            Using advance sophisticated technology we have found a way to take any text and derive the true meaning.

            Simply create a speaker, any speaker you want. 
            Then input the quote that has plagued your thoughts with confusion and introspection.
            Or type in your own quotes and find meaning from that. 
            Or enter random keys and see if you discover meaning from chaos the choice is yours.
